# Dart IndexOutOfBoundsException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element of a list using an invalid index, resulting in this exception.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version which handles potential index errors gracefully.
